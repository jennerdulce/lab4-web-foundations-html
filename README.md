# Lab 4: Web Fundamentals

## Overview

This project will provide a foundational understanding of a variety of HTML tags and their usecases.
- Learn proper structure
- Common practices and techniques
- Understand semantic HTML and accessibility principles
- Explore the relationship between HTML elements, JavaScript logic, and CSS styling
- Explore practical examples to reinforce learning

## Project Goals

By the end of this lab, we will have:
1. Learn Standards and Semantic Focused HTML Basic
2. HTML is the foundation of both a documentation in a site or the views of an application you build
3. HTML is a core technology in web development 
    - in fact, it is what JavaScript tends to emit / manipulate
4. HTML is trivial to get started with and very difficult to use properly, be forewarned that you will create a serious tech debt here if you don't pause and take it seriously
5. Explore using your IDE to preview web pages, validate pages in your IDE or using the validator, and utilizing the Browser's DevTools
6. Exploring More GitHub concepts and publish to GitHub Pages
